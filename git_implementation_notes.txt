GIT TUTORIAL NOTES — basic commands and workflow

To initialize a local git repository
		$ git init
Push to remote repository
		$ git push -u origin my_branch
Pull latest changes from remote repository
		$ git pull origin my_branch

This is the basic workflow of git:
	1: Modify a file from the working directory.
	2: Add these files to the staging area (add)
		$ git add file.txt
	3: Commit moves the files from the staging area (commit,push)
		$ git commit -m “Add file.txt”

		Working Directory
			|

		Staging Area

		Git repository

To check the status of your workflow, use status
		$ git status
To check the commit history (when things were added/removed), use log
		$ git log

Branches:
	To see all of your branches, use branch
		$ git branch
	To make a new branch, use branch new_branch
		$ git branch new_branch
	To switch to the new branch, use checkout
		$ git checkout new_branch
